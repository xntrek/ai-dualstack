## A Quick Guide to Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications, defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io/). 

The compose file is used to define what and how it is used to configure your Docker applicationâ€™s services, networks, volumes, and more.

With your compose file(s) in place, you can create and start your application(s) with a single command: `docker compose up`.

### docker-compose.yml sample:   

The top-level [`name`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/version-and-name/#name-top-level-element) property is defined by the Compose Specification as the project name to be used if you don't set one explicitly.
```
name: myapp

services:
  foo:
    image: busybox
    command: echo "I'm running ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}"
```
> <small>Please note: The top-level version property is now obsolete. It was defined for backward compatibility and is only informative. You'll receive a warning message that it is obsolete if used.</small>

A Compose file must declare a [`services`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/) top-level element as a map whose keys are string representations of service names, and whose values are service definitions. A service definition contains the configuration that is applied to each service container.

```
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: example
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./ollama_data:/root/.ollama
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

By default Compose sets up a single network for your app.  The top-level [`networks`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/networks/) element lets you configure named networks that can be reused across multiple services.

```
networks:
  frontend:
    # Specify driver options
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:   
      com.docker.network.bridge
      host_binding_ipv4: "127.0.0.1"   
  backend:   
    # Use a custom driver   
    driver: custom-driver
```

The top-level [`volumes`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/volumes/) declaration lets you configure named volumes that can be reused across multiple services. To use a volume across multiple services, you must explicitly grant each service access by using the volumes attribute within the services top-level element. 

```
services:
  backend:
    image: example/database
    volumes:
      - db-data:/etc/data

  backup:
    image: backup-service
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/backup/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```

The top-level configs declaration defines or references configuration data that is granted to services in your Compose application.

```
configs:
  http_config:
    file: ./httpd.conf
```
The top-level [`models`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/models/) section declares AI models that are used by your Compose application. 
```
services:
  app:
    image: app
    models:
      my_model:
        endpoint_var: MODEL_URL

models:
  my_model:
    model: ai/model
    context_size: 1024
    runtime_flags: 
      - "--a-flag"
      - "--another-flag=42"
```
