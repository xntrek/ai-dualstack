# A0: Executive Brief

## Purpose

Deliver a production-ready, secure “dual AI” platform:  
- **Private AI:** Local “second brain” for knowledge capture, with Qwen and vector database  
- **Public AI:** General-access generative platform for application dev, with Mistral, sync to public endpoints

## Business Value

- Enterprise-aligned skills pathway (architecture, MLOps, API, vector DBs)
- Air-gapped privacy for sensitive IP
- Industry application stack

---

## Core Capabilities

- GPU-accelerated inference (RTX 3060 passthrough on Proxmox VM)
- Parallel LLM services, isolated by context and user
- End-to-end monitoring, backup, disaster recovery
- Modular, extensible, open-source base

---

## Key Deliverables

- Dual-infrastructure (Private/Public) with isolated AI stacks
- Automated backup/restore (daily, weekly, disaster-ready)
- Web UI, API, and development-ready environments
- Model and vector DB integration playbooks

---

## Solution Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Core Infrastructure Setup (Proxmox, storage, networking)
- **Phase 2:** GPU Passthrough & AI VM/LXC
- **Phase 3:** Stack install (Ollama, Qdrant, ChromaDB)
- **Phase 4:** Monitoring, security, backup validation
- **Phase 5:** Application, fine-tuning, industry integration
